# SfM
Structure From Motion Takes images that can be found in Phase1/P3Data which are pictures of different angles of a building.
We know the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and the feature matching points from each image are found using SIFT.
Please Refer to the Report.pdf to learn more about this project and how we took these points and were able to find camera
poses for each frame.

# NeRF

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wy6H2WF_zuh0CVC7CdfEUqREQ6YLDz_2)

NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) is a method for constructing scenes through volumetric representation using images from different angles. The implementation and verification of NeRF can be find in the Google Colab project above. Also, you can find an gif animation on the Phase2 folder or here [Nerf-lego](https://github.com/aadhyap/SfM/blob/main/Phase2/NeRF-lego.gif)
